<h1>HoloViz Roadmap, as of 3/2020<a class="headerlink" href="#holoviz-roadmap-as-of-3-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>HoloViz helps coordinate between numerous independent open-source
projects, each with their own developers, priorities, and agendas. In
large part, the future of HoloViz is up to a distributed team of
developers that focus on the areas of greatest current interest and
need, including areas that specifically get current funding.</p>
<p>Immediate, already funded priorities for 2020 include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Ongoing maintenance, improved documentation and examples</strong>: As
always, there are various bugs and usability issues reported on the
issue tracker, and we will address these as time permits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved imaging, simulation, machine learning, and Earth science
workflows</strong>: Support for working with image and other
multidimensional data for visualization and machine-learning
applications, including on HPC systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simpler deployment of large-scale visualizations</strong>: Automatic
generation of slippy-map tiles for exploration of large datasets
using standard web servers. Already provided in Datashader, but
needs additional polishing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better Datashader integration with external plotting libraries
(HoloViews, Plotly, Matplotlib)</strong>: Datashader needs to provide
functions for supporting hover information, legends, colorbars, and
interactivity, which each plotting library can then use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support for maintaining Python-based projects</strong>: As maintainers of
a wide range of Python projects, we are working to minimize the cost
of maintaining each one, by sharing code for tracking versions,
making releases, providing example scripts, managing datasets,
documenting examples, testing examples (including notebooks), and
building websites. Projects addressing each of these areas are being
added to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyviz">PyViz Github organization</a>
and will be documented as they become mature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrating 3D surface and volume rendering into HoloViz</strong>: HoloViews
can plot limited quantities of 3D surface or point data using
<a class="reference external" href="http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/matplotlib/TriSurface.html">Matplotlib</a>
or
<a class="reference external" href="http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/plotly/TriSurface.html">Plotly</a>,
but other tools are needed for larger datasets or for volumetric
rendering with transparent/semitransparent voxels. Improving 3D
support could be as simple as providing examples for using existing
tools like
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume">IPyVolume</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://vaex.astro.rug.nl">Vaex</a>, or by wrapping JavaScript
libraries like <a class="reference external" href="https://threejs.org">ThreeJS</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://cesiumjs.org">CesiumJS</a>.  There’s a first <a class="reference external" href="http://assets.holoviews.org/demos/HoloViews_CesiumJS.html">prototype
for a CesiumJS backend now available</a>,
but lots more work to do to make it practical for real use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More extensive documentation about deployment</strong>: HoloViz includes a
tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="http://holoviz.org/tutorial/13_Deploying_Bokeh_Apps.html">deployment using Bokeh
server</a>,
but there are many other ways to set up live Python-backed plots
and Panel dashboards or apps, including creating a Flask server or
embedding into Django, along with deploying via Heroku or Google
Cloud and AWS or via the Anaconda Enterprise platform or on
<a class="reference external" href="https://mybinder.org">MyBinder</a>. Documenting and testing these
possibilities takes time and effort, and any contributions or
examples that will help people get started and decide between the
alternatives would be very helpful.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other things we’d like to see in HoloViz or in packages designed to work
well with HoloViz include:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Bokeh WebGL support</strong>: Bokeh provides good support for working
interactively with small datasets using an HTML Canvas (client-side
interactivity), and when combined with Datashader it can handle
enormous datasets by pre-rendering them to images in Python
(server-side). However, in between these two extremes there is a
range of data sizes that could be addressed well by the client-side
WebGL technology. Bokeh includes some WebGL support, but it is patchy
and not fully implemented, so it is not the default for either direct
Bokeh usage or for Bokeh with the HoloViews API. Volunteers to
maintain and expand the WebGL support could make a much broader range
of data sizes practical in easily redistributable standalone HTML
files, and could enable new classes of high-performance interactive
features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional plot types</strong>: HoloViews includes an extensive range of
plot types (Elements) covering the typical visualizations used across
many domains. However, there are always more that can be included,
and some domains are not as well covered as others. Some examples
that we’d like to include are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates">parallel
coordinates</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart">radar charts</a>
(polar parallel coordinates, or star charts)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemaps</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram">dendrograms</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladogram">cladograms</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_tree">radial trees</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46131572/making-a-non-overlapping-bubble-chart-in-matplotlib-circle-packing">packed
bubbles</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_chart">funnel charts</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>(And if someone wants to write and maintain a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart">pie chart</a> even though they are
nearly always the wrong thing to do, we can probably be convinced
to allow it. :-)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Better native GUI support</strong>: Right now, HoloViz focuses exclusively
on tools that work well in web browsers, because it aims to support
the entire workflow from initial exploration to delivery of fully
functional interactive applications to other stakeholders. One
consequence is that it doesn’t currently support the types of
interactivity provided by Matplotlib when used with its native GUI
backends like Qt. It should be feasible to make the interactive
functionality in HoloViews (e.g. streams and DynamicMaps) support
native GUI apps as well, allowing the same user code to be applied to
a wider range of use cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Altair/Vega/Vega-lite integration</strong>: HoloViews and Bokeh provide
declarative syntaxes that can be expressed in purely static form, and
it should be feasible to write a translator between them and other
declarative libraries like Altair, Vega, and Vega-Lite. Those
libraries are currently focused primarily on statistical
visualizations, not covering areas like multidimensional (image-like)
plotting where HoloViews and Bokeh are also used, but they offer a
common interchange format that could be helpful for interoperating
with other tools. Writing an import and export facility that covers
the bulk of the shared functionality should not be a major
undertaking and could open up interesting new applications. For now,
Altair and Vega-lite visualizations can be specified and then used
directly with Panel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>hvPlot/HoloViews serialization</strong>: HoloViews uses a declarative design that
can be represented in a purely textual form, without any Python code.
An initial implementation allows any Param-based objects (including
HoloViews objects) to be represented in JSON or YAML, but it needs
some polishing before it can be put into wide use for saving and
restoring configurations and layouts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better integration with ____</strong>: There are a lot of tools in the
Python and other scientific software ecosystems that could be
included in HoloViz or made easily usable from it. NetworkX (already
usable but not fully exploited yet) is just one example of many;
suggestions welcome!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GUI-based plot creation</strong>: (As in business intelligence and
dashboarding applications.) The powerful components available
in HoloViz are ready for Python users to put together into
visualizations and apps, but they would also make a very strong
base for building a graphical approach for working with data, with
drag and drop layouts, GUI-configurable mapping of data sources, and
GUI configuration of the plot objects. HoloViews components are
already declarative, which means that they can be mapped directly
into GUI elements for changing their parameters dynamically. Paired
with the new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/intake">Intake</a>
library for declaring data sources, it would be possible to build a
fully graphical interface for working with data that would have the
advantage of being backed by a fully configurable, open-source set
of plotting library elements, ensuring that when people outgrow
the GUI framework they can easily extend and expand anything
developed in it, unlike current business intelligence and
dashboarding applications.</p></li>
